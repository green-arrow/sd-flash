#sd-flash

Use at your own risk!

## Description

This is a quick utility I created to help me flash SD cards with a Linux distro (specifically for use on a
Raspberry Pi).

## How to use

Install globally

```
npm install -g sd-flash
```

Run as sudo:

```
sudo sd-flash
```

Follow the prompts to supply the application with the needed parameters.

Wait for the image to be flashed.

That's all!
